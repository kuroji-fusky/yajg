# YAJG

Yet another JSON Generator

A GUI scaffolding tool that let's you generate boilerplate for things like:
- Generating dummy data, built-in faker.js support lmao
- Scaffolding project details, stuff like package.json
- Adding i18n functionality
- PWA

You can use the tool on its own, or use the pre-made templates or make your
own template to make things easier!

Template(s) plan to add:
- package.json
- Minimal VSCode Theme Plugin
- Random data
- Config files that can be exported as either JavaScript or TypeScript files
  - Scaffold to something like Tailwind, and other big framework plugins, etc.

## "But there are other tools like this one!"

I know; and I've only built it for my own and other peoples' convienience sakes;
in addition, I've seen tools somewhat close to this but have horrible UI, and it
intrigues me to make a better version of it.
